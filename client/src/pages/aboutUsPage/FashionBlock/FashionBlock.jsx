            Nowadays, fashion is changing at the speed of light. Each new season brings new trends
            that require us to update our wardrobes. However, more and more people are beginning to
            think about the cost of such an update and how harmful it is to the environment.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.modalCookies__text}>
            Fast fashion, which is in constant motion, causes huge damage to the environment. Such
            rapid production leads to a large amount of waste and pollution of water and air. In
            addition, constant pressure on manufacturers leads to the exploitation of labor
            resources and violations of workers&#39; rights.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.modalCookies__text}>
            In turn, slow fashion is aimed at producing high-quality and durable items that can last
            for many years. This means that slow fashion manufacturers use quality materials and
            favor handmade work, further reducing the environmental footprint.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.modalCookies__text}>
            In conclusion, instead of following fashion trends and buying a lot of clothes that
            quickly go out of style and wear out quickly, we should consider investing in quality
            and durable items that will look stylish and modern for many years to come.
